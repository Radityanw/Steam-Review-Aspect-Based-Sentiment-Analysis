1091500,"The open world feels lifeless because of lackluster NPC behavior and plays like a first person GTA knockoff with not enough depth to your actions. Stealing vehicles? Only temporarily. Getting a house in your preferred corner of the world? Nah. Anything meaningful to do apart from story quests, side quests, and shopping? No. It really feels like a game where you get to create a character but don't get the ability to really do anything with them that portrays you, the player, as the character in this world.

This is especially true with the insignificant ""branches"" or ""life paths"" which, alongside choices throughout the game, are mostly inconsequential. The game really feels like it wants to cover as much of the ""killer features"" that people like seeing like custom guns and gear, skill trees, lots of options to tackle combat, driving, etc. but at the cost of any significant depth to those mechanics in order to make the game feel like an RPG instead of a looter-shooter with GTA elements and some differing gameplay depending on your choices every blue moon.",FALSE,2021-08-08

I crashed like twice but didn't have a problem after I got the new game ready drivers. I'm literally making this review as a reminder. Had a blast so far but jesus guys, update your nvidia drivers.

ULTRA EDIT:
[h1]A Flawed but Fun Experience[/h1]

I might as well actually review this game in its current state considering the attention this got, while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay. 

It is a Witcher 3 reskin with a cyberpunk setting, considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excels, the dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengaging, it is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punch, very satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but broken, I did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugs, less severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style. 

Ultimately I invest in player agency/good writing and fun gameplay at the end of the day, the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and that's really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch. 

All of that being said, if you're the type that is a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored, or Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like this, you usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinity, etc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state. 

In conclusion, this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else though, it does fail here and there but, in my opinion, not enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.

Also driving anything is just plain awful, it depends on what you're driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever you're driving but I'm just talking out of my ass at this point.",TRUE,2020-12-10
1091500,"I dodged all the hype before the launch, having seen only one cinematic trailer and that's it. So I think that's one of the main reasons I've enjoyed this game A LOT... given the fact that I don't like cyberpunk setting, like, at all, and I'm not too fond of GTA-types of games either.

...so what can be said after 125 hours?

Unpolished and buggy? Yep
Glitchy and resource demanding? Yep
Next-gen gameplay? Nope
Next-gen graphics? Hmm.. no, I don't think so

....great story, amazing setting, catchy characters? Immersive and huge open world? A lot of stuff to do besides main story line? OH HELL YES!!!

If you're too sensitive to bugs and glitches, wait up a bit till they fix it, but I didn't encounter anything THAT game breaking. Good game it is!

Edit 1: Improvements and Phantom Liberty

Boy, has this game improved over the years! The Night City has blossomed, to put it mildly. So many things fixed and features added. I mean, I thoroughly enjoyed the game at launch, but had it been released in this state back then, it would have been glorious. Well, it certainly is glorious now, so yeah, it's obvious that the devs have put a tremendous amount of effort into their game.

Now, about Phantom Liberty... I don't know where to start, really. I think I've learned the difference between DLC and Expansion. Truly, this is not some petty DLC stuff. It looks like a standalone game rather than an expansion, especially compared to actual games that are being released nowadays. The story is rock solid, with so many different paths that it makes you want to replay it until you find the outcome that suits you best. Also, you unveil different sides and aspects of the said story when you choose to go this or that way, which really expands the experience.

The whole new area of Dogtown could have been bigger, in my opinion, but don't get me wrong, it really is big. I just can't get enough of it. It's a huge addition to the game map with its own unique atmosphere, features, events, quests, etc.

I also have to give it to Idris Elba, who did an outstanding job, and it's no less impressive than what has already been done by Keanu Reeves. They both delivered fantastic performances, and I must admit I don't know any other celebrity in any other game whose appearance is anywhere near what those two have done. It's not just some visual resemblance of an in-game model or a cinematic feature. It's a full-on acting performance. The amount of dialogue is enormous, and it is acting, not just ""here, I'll read my lines."" It's clear that they are invested in their characters and strive to deliver the best performance they can.

Overall, this is a must-have game in every gamer's library. As I mentioned above, I'm not really into the cyberpunk setting, but this game has changed my perception of the genre. I really enjoyed it, and I envy those who will experience it for the first time now. It's worth every cent, and I eagerly await what comes next.",TRUE,2021-01-30
