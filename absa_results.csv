review,analysis
"The open world feels lifeless because of lackluster NPC behavior and plays like a first person GTA knockoff with not enough depth to your actions. Stealing vehicles? Only temporarily. Getting a house in your preferred corner of the world? Nah. Anything meaningful to do apart from story quests, side quests, and shopping? No. It really feels like a game where you get to create a character but don't get the ability to really do anything with them that portrays you, the player, as the character in this world.

This is especially true with the insignificant ""branches"" or ""life paths"" which, alongside choices throughout the game, are mostly inconsequential. The game really feels like it wants to cover as much of the ""killer features"" that people like seeing like custom guns and gear, skill trees, lots of options to tackle combat, driving, etc. but at the cost of any significant depth to those mechanics in order to make the game feel like an RPG instead of a looter-shooter with GTA elements and some differing gameplay depending on your choices every blue moon.","1. Gameplay: Negative
Reason: The reviewer observed a lackluster open-world experience, with activities like stealing vehicles and owning a house being limited or unavailable, and branching ""life paths"" seeming insignificant. The game offers custom guns, gear, and skill-trees to tackle combat and driving, but the reviewer believes these mechanics lack depth compared to an RPG.

2. Graphics Fidelity: Not mentioned.

3. Story: Negative
Reason: Although the reviewer doesn't specifically mention the story, they express dissatisfaction with the shallow open-world gameplay and non-consequential choices.

4. Technical: Not mentioned.

5. World: Negative
Reason: The reviewer mentions that the open world feels lifeless due to uninteresting NPC behavior and not enough meaningful activities.

6. Multiplayer: Not mentioned."
